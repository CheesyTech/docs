# Laravel

Laravel provides an official integration with RoadRunner via [Laravel Octane](https://github.com/laravel/octane).

As an alternative, the community-driven [Laravel Bridge](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/laravel-bridge) package offers deeper integration with RoadRunner's full plugin ecosystem, including support for Jobs, gRPC, and Temporal. It also maintains compatibility with Octane's application state management.
