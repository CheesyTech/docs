# 🚀 v2024.2.1 🚀

### `OTEL` plugin:

- 🔥: Several improvements by @devnev: Do not set `Endpoint` and `Headers` for gRPC if they're empty: [PR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/otel/pull/62), Support standard `OTEL` exporter protocol environment variables: [PR](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/otel/pull/63). (thanks @devnev)

### `RoadRunner-Temporal` plugin:
- 🐛: gRPC client closed too early after shutdown: [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/1986). (thanks @kkosowski-p)

### `AMQP` driver:
- 🐛: `redial_timeout` was not respected when dynamically creating pipeline. [BUG](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/issues/2000), (thanks @algirdasci)

### <center>🧹 Chore:</center>

- 🧑‍🏭: All plugins were updated to Go 1.23 (including `Velox` Dockerfile).
