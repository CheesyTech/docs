# 🚀 v2024.3.0 🚀

Meet the new RoadRunner release! This time we have a lot of new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Let's dive in! In this realse we have added a new feature called [Auto Workers Scaling](https://docs.roadrunner.dev/docs/php-worker/auto-scaling). This feature allows users to scale their RoadRunner workers automatically, up to 100 additional workers. `SQS` plugin was significantly reworked without major breaking changes, please, read the updated documentation carefully. `RoadRunner-Temporal`plugin now supports API-Keys (which would be added via our SDK-PHP and documentated in it as well).
