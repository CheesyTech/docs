# Upgrade guide: [link](https://docs.roadrunner.dev/general/compatibility)

## Community plugins

We are introducing a new term in the RoadRunner community â€” Community plugins. 
If you have a brilliant idea for the http middleware or JOBS driver or even a new plugin - feel free to check our 
[Customization](../customization) tutorials, create and notify us about your plugin.

## Plugins updates:

### ðŸ”¥ Meet the new JOBS driver - Google Pub/Sub
RoadRunner now supports the Google Pub/Sub queues. Currently, this driver is released in **BETA** and has a few limitations which you may find in the [docs]()

### `AMQP` and `Kafka` JOBS drivers

- ðŸ”¥ Support an auto-restart pipeline on redial or some fatal problems when connecting to the RabbitMQ broker. Instead of silently exit from the pipeline, RR will try to re-initialize the pipeline.

Thanks to our PHP team, [KV](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/kv/releases/tag/v4.3.0) now has `AsyncStorageInterface` support which makes your experience with the KV plugin even faster.
Feel free to read the technical details here: [link](https://github.com/roadrunner-php/goridge/pull/22)

### Samples repository

- ðŸ”¥ Our RoadRunner samples repository was updated and now includes a `Jobs` driver example for the `Jobs` plugin.
More info here: [link](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/samples).


### Our Go-SDK was deprecated

- ðŸ˜­ Our Go-SDK was deprecated and split into separate packages. Read more in the Upgrade guide.


### Velox configuration update

- ðŸ”¥ Velox configuration was simplified:

```yaml
[roadrunner]
  # ref -> reference, tag, commit or branch
  ref = "v2024.2.0"

# the debug option is used to build RR with debug symbols to profile it with pprof
[debug]
enabled = false

## Rest is the same ....
```

Now, there is no need to include `linker` flags, and buildtime + build version would be inherited automatically.
If you need to debug your binary, please, use the `debug` option set to `true`.
